# Lab: Aries Agent Test Harness

## Overview

In this lab, we'll take a look at the Aries Agent Test Harness that can be used for testing Aries agent interoperability.

## How to Run

We’ll run this lab from the GitHub repository for the Aries Agent Test Harness, relying on it for “how to run” guidance.

## Instructions

All the instructions you need to try out (and even contribute to) the Aries Agent Test Harness are in the repo. Click [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-agent-test-harness/blob/main/README.md)
and follow the instructions at the top of the document (before the table of contents) for how to do a quick first run of the tests in the harness.
Unfortunately, you can't use Play with Docker with the Aries Agent Test Harness, so you will have to run the lab on your own system.

Once you have done a first run of the test harness, check out the rest of the documentation in the repo to learn (lots) more about the test harness, its architecture, the tests,
how to add tests, and how to add support for testing your own "component under test."

## Takeaways

The Aries Agent Test Harness (AATH) is a way to create and run interoperability tests across multiple agents and agent frameworks. With just one command, you ran
over 400 tests of Aries RFC protocols using two Aries agent frameworks. That's pretty cool!

That's it for this lab! Please return to the course.
