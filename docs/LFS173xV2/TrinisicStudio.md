# Lab: Trying out Trinsic Studios

## Overview

In this lab, we'll take a look at an Aries implementation offered commercially using an "Agent-as-a-Service" model. That
makes your work as a developer a lot easier, as most of what you will be doing is configuration and you won't need to deploy
anything on your on servers, locally or in cloud--the services offered by [Trinsic](https://trinsic.id) will do the heavy lifting.
Depending on your use case, you will likely still have to integrate the agent activities with your business application. Your application
might be constrained by what can be done on the platform, and your keys will be handled on the Trinsic platform. Regarding integrations, Trinsic
does provide some interesting options, such as the use of [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) to implement
event triggers between your apps and your Trinsic Studio agent.

## How to Run

A prerequisite for this lab is that you have to sign up for Trinsic Studio. It will be free for what you are doing, (cool!) you can get and use
a verifiable credential to login to your account.

## Instructions

The instructions for the lab are all on the Trinsic site, as follows:

- Go through the [introduction](https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/introduction) to the platform.
- Intrigued? If you want to go further, [sign up](https://studio.trinsic.id/SignUp) for an account.
- Finally, run the [Trinsic Studio tutorial](https://docs.trinsic.id/docs/tutorial) to give the Trinsic Studio a try.

That should give you enough of a taste to decide if you want to keep going with the "as a Service" model.

## Takeaways

Trinsic Studio is an interesting take on the use of Aries. Even if all you do is the tutorial, you should detect
the same Aries patterns you've learned about in looking at other Aries frameworks.

That's it for this lab! Please return to the course.
