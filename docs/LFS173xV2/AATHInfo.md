# Lab: Aries Agent Test Harness Info page

## Overview

In this lab we'll look at the Aries Interop Profile information page. This page displays the results of the CI ("Continuous Interoperability") tests that are run using the Aries Agent Test Harness for combinations of Aries Test Agents. In addition to looking at the results, we'll look at how to use the data collected for every step of every test case of every test execution (that's a lot of data!) to diagnose errors in the test runs.

## How to Run

Nothing tricky here...you just need to click on some links on a couple of websites. Of course, those that want to go above and beyond might want to really dig into a failure, look at the code, engage with the Aries Agent Test Harness team, and perhaps open an issue about a failure--or even submit a Pull Request. Your choice! 

## Instructions

1. Review the [Aries Interop Info](https://aries-interop.info) page. How is Aries Interop looking right now?
2. Drill into a specific test run failure by following [these instructions](https://aries-interop.info/aries-interop-intro.html#investigating-failing-tests) to do just that.

## Takeaways

Interoperability is crucial to Aries deployments. One organization can't (and shouldn't!) build everything in the Aries ecosystem,
so it is crucial there are ways to verify interoperability and to see the status of that verification. The https://aries-interop.info site
makes it possible to see on an ongoing basis just what that status is. If you are working on Aries, we recommend bookmarking this page
and checking it from time to time to see what is happening in the ecosystem.

That's it for this lab! Please return to the course.
